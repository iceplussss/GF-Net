# Generative Fermionic Neural Network State (GF-Net)

GF-Net is a deep neural network ansatz for many-body electronic states within second quantization framework.  It can be used for calculating electronic ground states of molecular systems with variational Monte Carlo (VMC) algorithm.

Unlike other VMC methods, GF-Net can generate stochastic samples in parallel, as a substitute of sequential Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.  When running on GPUs, GFNet is expected to be much more efficient than MCMC on stochastic sampling. 



## Structure of GF-Net

A GF-Net is essentially a deep autoregressive neural network. It is constructed in an iterative way:

where $Î¸_i$ is a real function satisfying the normalization condition

The GF-Net is similar to the WaveNet (*Oord, Aaron van den, et al. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.03499 (2016)*) but specially adapted for representing anti-symmetric Fermionic many-body quantum states. The figure below is a schematic representation of GF-Net.

## Parallel Sampling
Similar to the neural autoregressive quantum state (*Sharir, Or, et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 124.2 (2020): 020503*), GF-Net allows the parallel sampling according to the probability distribution represented by itself. The figure below sketches the sampling procedure.

## Benchmark

The ground states of H-H and Li-H are used to benchmark the accuracy of GF-Net:

The results of GF-Net are in agreement with the full configuration interaction (FCI) results, significantly better than the Hartree Fock (HF) results.
